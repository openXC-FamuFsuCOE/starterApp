Driving more Efficiently 

SOurce: https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/driveHabits.jsp

-Drive Sensibly (aggressive driving like speeding, rapid acceleration and braking will waste gas)
-Speed Limit (when you drive over the speed limit 50mph the gas mileage usually decrease)
-Cargo doesn't exceed the limit of 100pounds this would decrease your mpg by 1%
-idling (using your ac while in park or just in park. need to drive atleast 5 miles between start cycles to fully recharge battery
amd limit to starting your 10x a day (note that any shutdown longer than 1 minute will save you money

This website expresses how to program the vehicle interface with different type of operating systems 


Meeting with Dr. Perry and Dr. Bernadin 
-we could research about the 


FUEL EFFICIENCY IS THE GOAL

Idling - REZ
Signals we need 
-ignition_status
-vehicle speed
-transmission_gear_position 
-odometer (show the total distance 
-cargo weight limit? we could ask Tellis if there is a signal 
- signal on how long the car has been on 
**ignition status how long it was on RUN



Beginning settings of the app
