 * OBD2_IGNITION_CHECK - Actively query for the engine and vehicle speed with
 *      OBD-II diagnostic requests and suspend the VI when both are 0 for a few
 *      seconds. The VI will wake up when the CAN bus becomes active and also
 *      periodically will wake up and re-send the requests to be able to detect
 *      when the car is powered on but hides all normal mode CAN messages. Short
 *      of having a standard ignition status message, this combination of data
