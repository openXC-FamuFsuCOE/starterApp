:Version: 7.0.1
:Web: http://openxcplatform.com
:Documentation: http://vi-firmware.openxcplatform.com
:Source: http://github.com/openxc/vi-firmware

The OpenXC vehicle interface (VI) firmware runs on a microcontroller connected
to one or more CAN buses. It receives either all CAN messages or a filtered
subset, performs any unit conversion or factoring required and outputs a generic
version to a USB, Bluetooth or network interface.

.. WARNING::
   This portion of the site covers advanced topics such as writing and compiling
   your own firmware from source. These steps are NOT required for flashing a
   pre-compiled binary firmware.

   If you've downloaded a pre-built binary firmware for your car, locate your VI
   in the `list of supported interfaces
   <http://openxcplatform.com/vehicle-interface/hardware.html>`_ to find
   instructions for programming it. You don't need anything from the VI firmware
   documentation itself - most users don't need anything in this documentation.
   Here be dragons!
