Read-only Configuration Examples
================================

If you haven't created a custom firmware for the OpenXC VI yet, we recommend the
`getting started with custom data guide
<http://vi-firmware.openxcplatform.com/en/master/getting-started/getting-started.html>`_.

For all examples, the ``name`` field for a message is optional but strongly
encouraged to help keep track of the mapping between a message ID and something
human readable.

When an example refers to "sending" a simple vehicle message or CAN message, it
means sending to the app developer via one of the output interfaces (e.g. USB,
Bluetooth) and not sending to the CAN bus. For examples of configuring writable
messages and signals that *do* write back to the CAN bus, see the :doc:`write
configuration examples <write-examples>`.

.. _onebus-onesignal:

One Bus, One Numeric Signal
==============================

We want to read a single, numeric signal from a high speed bus on controller 1.
The signal is 7 bits wide, starting from bit 5 in message ID ``0x102``. We want
the name of the signal for OpenXC app developers to be
``my_openxc_measurement``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x102": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_openxc_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 5,
                       "bit_size": 7
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

With this configuration, the VI will publish the received CAN signal using the
`OpenXC simple vehicle message format
<https://github.com/openxc/openxc-message-format/blob/next/JSON.mkd#simple-vehicle-message>`_,
e.g. when using the JSON output format:

.. code-block:: js

   {"name": "my_openxc_measurement", "value": 42}

.. _basic-transformed:

Transformed Numeric Signal
==========================

We want to read the same signal as in the :ref:`One Bus, One Numeric Signal
<onebus-onesignal>` example, but we want to transform the value with a factor
and offset before publishing it. The value on CAN must be multiplied by -1.0 and
offset by 1400.


.. code-block:: javascript

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x102": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_openxc_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 5,
                       "bit_size": 7,
                       "factor": -1.0,
                       "offset": 1400
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

We added the ``factor`` and ``offset`` attributes to the signal.

One Bus, One Boolean Signal
===========================

We want to read a boolean signal from a high speed bus on controller 1.
The signal is 1 bits wide, starting from bit 32 in message ID ``0x103``. We want
the name of the signal for OpenXC app developers to be
``my_boolean_measurement``. Because it is a boolean type, the value will appear
as ``true`` or ``false`` in the JSON for app developers.

.. code-block:: javascript

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x103": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Boolean_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_boolean_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 32,
                       "bit_size": 1,
                       "decoder": "booleanDecoder"
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

We set the ``decoder`` for the signal to the ``booleanDecoder``, one of the
:ref:`built-in signal decoders <signal-decoders>` - this will transform
the numeric value from the bus (a ``0`` or ``1``) into first-class boolean
values (``true`` or ``false``).

With this configuration, the VI will publish the received CAN signal using the
`OpenXC simple vehicle message format
<https://github.com/openxc/openxc-message-format/blob/next/JSON.mkd#simple-vehicle-message>`_,
e.g. when using the JSON output format:

.. code-block:: js

   {"name": "my_boolean_measurement", "value": true}

.. _state-based:

One Bus, One State-based Signal
===============================

We want to read a signal from a high speed bus on controller 1 that has numeric
values corresponding to a set of states - what we call a state-based signal

The signal is 3 bits wide, starting from bit 28 in message ID ``0x104``. We want
the name of the signal for OpenXC app developers to be
``active_state``. There are 6 valid states from 0-5, and we want those to
appears as the state strings ``a`` through ``f`` in the JSON for app developers.

.. code-block:: javascript

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x104": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_State_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "active_state",
                       "bit_position": 28,
                       "bit_size": 3,
                       "states": {
                           "a": [0],
                           "b": [1],
                           "c": [2],
                           "d": [3],
                           "e": [4],
                           "f": [5]
                       }
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

We set the ``states`` field for the signal to a JSON object, mapping the string
value for each state to the numerical values to which it corresponds. This
automatically will set the ``decoder`` to the ``stateDecoder``, one of the
:ref:`built-in signal decoder functions <signal-decoders>`.

With this configuration, the VI will publish the received CAN signal using the
`OpenXC simple vehicle message format
<https://github.com/openxc/openxc-message-format/blob/next/JSON.mkd#simple-vehicle-message>`_,
e.g. when using the JSON output format:

.. code-block:: js

   {"name": "active_state", "value": "a"}

Combined State-based Signal
===========================

We want to read the same state-based signal from :ref:`state-based` but we want
the values 0-3 on the bus to all correspond with state ``a`` and values ``4-5``
to the string state ``b``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x104": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_State_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "active_state",
                       "bit_position": 28,
                       "bit_size": 3,
                       "states": {
                           "a": [0, 1, 2, 3],
                           "b": [4, 5]
                       }
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

Each state string maps to an array - this can seem unnecessary when you only
have 1 numeric value for each state, but it allows combined mappings as in this
example.

.. _twobus:

Two Buses, Two Signals
======================

We want to read two numeric signals - one from a message on a high speed bus on
controller 1, and the other from a message on a medium speed bus on controller
2.

The signal on the high speed bus is 12 bits wide, starting from bit 11 in
message ID ``0x108``. We want the name of the signal for OpenXC app developers
to be ``my_first_measurement``.

The signal on the medium speed bus 14 bits wide, starting from bit 0 in message
ID ``0x90``. We want the name of the signal for OpenXC app developers to be
``my_second_measurement``.

.. code-block:: javascript

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           },
           "ms": {
               "controller": 2,
               "speed": 125000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x108": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_first_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 11,
                       "bit_size": 12
                   }
               }
           },
           "0x90": {
               "bus": "ms",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Other_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_second_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 0,
                       "bit_size": 14
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

We added the second bus to the ``buses`` field and assigned it to controller 2.
We added the second message object and made sure to set its ``bus`` field to
``ms``.

With this configuration, the VI will publish the received CAN signal using the
`OpenXC simple vehicle message format
<https://github.com/openxc/openxc-message-format/blob/next/JSON.mkd#simple-vehicle-message>`_,
e.g. when using the JSON output format:

.. code-block:: js

   {"name": "my_first_measurement", "value": 42}
   {"name": "my_second", "value": 942}

.. _limited-simple:

Limited Simple Vehicle Message Signal Rate
===========================================

We want to read the same signal as in the :ref:`One Bus, One Numeric Signal
<onebus-onesignal>` example, but we want it to be sent at a maximum of 5Hz. We
want the firmware to pick out messages at a regular period, but we don't care
which data is dropped in order to stay under the maximum.

.. code-block:: javascript

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x102": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_openxc_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 5,
                       "bit_size": 7,
                       "max_frequency": 5
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

We set the ``max_frequency`` field of the signal to 5 (meaning 5Hz) - the
firmware will automatically handle skipping messages to stay below this limit.

.. _limited-simple-unchanged:

Limited Simple Message Rate if Unchanged
===========================================

We want the same signal from :ref:`limited-simple` at a limited rate, but we
don't want to lose any information - if the value of the signal changes, we want
it to be sent regardless of the max frequency. Repeated, duplicate signal values
are fairly common in vehicles, where a signal is sent at a steady frequency
even if the value hasn't changed. For this example, we want to preserve all
information - if a signal changes, we want to make sure the data is sent.

.. code-block:: javascript

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x102": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_openxc_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 5,
                       "bit_size": 7,
                       "max_frequency": 5,
                       "force_send_changed": true
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

We added the ``force_send_changed`` field to the signal, which will make sure
the signal is sent immediately when the value changes. This rate limiting is
lossless.

.. _send-on-change:

Send Signal on Change Only
===========================

We want to limit the rate of a signal as in :ref:`limited-simple-unchanged`,
but we want to be more strict - the signal should only be published if it
actually changes.

.. code-block:: javascript

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x102": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_openxc_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 5,
                       "bit_size": 7,
                       "send_same": false
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

We accomplish this by setting the ``send_same`` field to false. This is most
appropriate for boolean and state-based signals where the transition is most
important. Considering that a host device may connect to the VI *after* the
message has been sent, using this field has the potential of making it difficult
to tell the current state of the vehicle on startup - you have to wait for a
state change before knowing any values. For that reason, we've moved away from
using this for most firmware (using a combination of a ``max_frequency`` of 1Hz
and ``force_send_changed == true``) but the option is still available.

.. _mapped:

Separate Files for Message Sets
===============================

Starting from the :ref:`twobus` example, we want to split up the configuration
into mutiple files because it's getting too big and hard to follow. This will
especially be true as we add more message and signals.

Starting from this complete configuration:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           },
           "ms": {
               "controller": 2,
               "speed": 125000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x108": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_first_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 11,
                       "bit_size": 12
                   }
               }
           },
           "0x90": {
               "bus": "ms",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Other_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_second_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 0,
                       "bit_size": 14
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

we move the messages that we want to read from the ``hs`` bus to the file
``hs.json``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "messages": {
           "0x108": {
               "signals": {
                   "My_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_first_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 11,
                       "bit_size": 12
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

and we move the messages that we want to read from the ``ms`` bus to the file
``ms.json``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "messages": {
           "0x90": {
               "signals": {
                   "My_Other_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_second_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 0,
                       "bit_size": 14
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }


Notice in both of these files, the messages no longer have the ``bus`` attribute
- we're instead going to specify that in the top level configuration:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           },
           "ms": {
               "controller": 2,
               "speed": 125000
           }
       },
       "mappings": [
           {"mapping": "hs.json", "bus": "hs"},
           {"mapping": "ms.json", "bus": "ms"}
       ]
   }

The primary advantage of using separate files is readability, but it also makes
the message definitions more re-usable between vehicle platforms and buses. For
example, we could quickly parse all of the messages from the ``ms.json`` mapping
file from the ``hs`` bus instead of ``ms`` by flipping the ``bus`` attribute in
the top-level config file.

Mapped from a DBC File
=======================

If you use Vector DBC files to store your "gold standard" CAN signal
definitions, you can save some effort by exporting the DBC to an XML file and
merging it with your VI configuration file. You won't need to manually copy the
``bit_position``, ``bit_size``, ``factor`` and ``offset`` attributes.

If we are to implement :ref:`onebus-onesignal` manually, we would use this
configuration file:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "messages": {
           "0x102": {
               "bus": "hs",
               "signals": {
                   "My_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_openxc_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 5,
                       "bit_size": 7,
                       "factor": -1.0,
                       "offset": 1400
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

If the message and signal is defined in a DBC file, we can save some effort.
Using a program like Vector CANdb++, export the DBC file to XML. Place the XML
file in the same directory as your JSON configuration file. We need to first
split up the configuration into a mapped messages file and a top-level config,
as in :ref:`mapped` example.

In our ``config.json``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "mappings": [
            {"mapping": "hs.json", "bus": "hs"}
       ]
   }

and in ``hs.json``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "messages": {
           "0x102": {
               "signals": {
                   "My_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_openxc_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 5,
                       "bit_size": 7,
                       "factor": -1.0,
                       "offset": 1400
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

Now that we have the DBC exported to an XML file (we'll assume it's named
``exported-hs.xml``), we can remove the ``bit_position``, ``bit_size``,
``factor`` and ``offset`` fields and let them be imported from the XML - the
only thing required is a ``generic_name``:

In our ``config.json``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           }
       },
       "mappings": [
            {"mapping": "hs.json",
               "bus": "hs",
               "database": "exported-hs.xml"}
       ]
   }

and in ``hs.json``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "messages": {
           "0x102": {
               "signals": {
                   "My_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_openxc_measurement"
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

It's not huge savings for 1 signal, but once you get a dozen it can save a lot
of effort and opportunities for bugs.

Same Message ID, Two Buses
===============================

One shortcoming of a single configuration file is that you can't define a CAN
message with the same ID to exist on two different, buses. For example, this
isn't value JSON because the ``0x100`` key is repeated:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "messages": {
           "0x100": {
               "bus": "hs"
            },
            "0x100": {
               "bus": "ms"
            }
       }
   }

Instead, you can use mappings files as in :ref:`mapped` and put the messages
for each bus in separate files. Here's the main configuration file:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {   "buses": {
           "hs": {
               "controller": 1,
               "speed": 500000
           },
           "ms": {
               "controller": 2,
               "speed": 125000
           }
       },
       "mappings": [
           {"mapping": "hs.json", "bus": "hs"},
           {"mapping": "ms.json", "bus": "ms"}
       ]
   }

and here's ``hs.json``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "messages": {
           "0x100": {
                "My_Signal": {
                    "generic_name": "my_first_measurement",
                    "bit_position": 3,
                    "bit_size": 7
                }
           }
       }
   }

and finally, ``ms.json``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "messages": {
           "0x100": {
               "signals": {
                   "My_Other_Signal": {
                       "generic_name": "my_second_measurement",
                       "bit_position": 0,
                       "bit_size": 14
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

The two different CAN messages with the same ID can co-exist in these separate
files, linked as mappings through the main config.
