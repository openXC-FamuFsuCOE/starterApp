Python Library
----------------------

The `OpenXC Python library`_, in particular the `openxc-dashboard` tool, is
useful for testing the VI with a regular computer, to verify the
data received from a vehicle before introducing an Android device. Documentation
for this tool (and the list of required dependencies) is available on the OpenXC
`vehicle interface testing`_ page.
